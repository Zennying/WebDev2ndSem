web/portal/ // folder containing login page (just input stuff and it will work, but make sure email is in an email form even if it's kung ano ano).  
web/media/videos // was used as animated bg, deleted as it's too big (KYAH!).  
web/itemInventory // contains the pages after logging in.  
web/itemInventory/productInventory // directory that holds the pages that shows the list of items in table format.  

src/java // contains the packages and servlets.  
src/java/dbPackage // directory that holds all servlets with database functionalities.  
src/java/portal // current directory for the servlet of login page (placeholder as still no actual db and encryption functions).  
src/java/productTable // used by the pages found in web/itemInventory/productInventory when going from one jsp to another.
